# firapul.github.io

This is the edition interface for [http://firapul.ch](firapul.ch). If you want to modify the content showed, you can edit `index.md` (the landing page) or `legal.md` (the _Menzioni Legali_ page). Each of these is made of 2 parts : a header and the content itself, separated by a `-----`. The site's informations are in `_config.yml`. The provided description will appear on google when someone searches Firapul.

There also are options to modify the theme, but that's a bit more complicated, please email me at lafleur@boum.org for some clues on this.
